# AndroidDev-ForegroundActivity

# Goals
This Proof of Concept was an attempt on my part to build a template for a foregroundActivity, which is similar to a background activity, except that this type makes its presence known to the user via a persistent notification and is much less likley to be killed by the system.

# Funcitonality
This POC does not actually do much at all, besides create a persistent notification. This app is meant to be a template, and it fits that role fairly well. No actually do background work, I just need to add the 'work' into the work class that is associated with the foreground activity.

# Problems Encountered
I did not encounter any notible issues when developing this particular app, in fact, it was made remarkably simple due to en excellent tutorial from the channel Coding In Flow, which I have linked to in the tools section of this README
